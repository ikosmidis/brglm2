Description: Estimation and inference from generalized linear models based on various methods for bias reduction. The `brglmFit` fitting method can achieve reduction of estimation bias either through the mean bias-reducing adjusted score approach in Firth (1993) <https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/80.1.27> and Kosmidis and Firth (2009) <https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asp055>, or through the median bias-reduction adjusted scores approach in Kenne et al. (2016) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04768>, or through the direct subtraction of an estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator from the maximum likelihood estimates as in Cordeiro and McCullagh (1991) <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592>. Estimation in all cases takes place via a quasi Fisher scoring algorithm, and S3 methods for the construction of of confidence intervals for the reduced-bias estimates are provided. In the special case of generalized linear models for binomial and multinomial responses, the adjusted score approaches return estimates with improved frequentist properties, that are also always finite, even in cases where the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete and quasi-complete separation). brglm2 also provides pre-fit and post-fit methods for the detection of separation and of infinite maximum likelihood estimates in binomial response generalized linear models.
