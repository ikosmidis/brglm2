\arguments{
\item{epsilon}{positive convergence tolerance epsilon. Default is
\code{1e-06}.}

\item{epsilonExp}{positive  epsilon used to individuate the maximum quantile value
for which the probality mass of the negative binomial distribution sum to almost 1.
Default is \code{1e-15}.}

\item{maxit}{integer giving the maximal number of iterations
allowed. Default is \code{100}.}

\item{trace}{logical indicating if output should be produced for
each iteration. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{type}{the type of fitting method to be used. The options are
\code{AS_mean} (mean-bias reducing adjusted scores),
\code{AS_median} (median-bias reducing adjusted scores),
\code{AS_mixed} (bias reduction using mixed score adjustments;
default), \code{correction} (asymptotic bias correction),
\code{MPL_Jeffreys} (maximum penalized likelihood with powers of the
Jeffreys prior as penalty) and\code{ML} (maximum likelihood).}

\item{transformation}{the transformation of the dispersion to be
estimated. Default is \code{identity}. See Details.}

\item{slowit}{a positive real used as a multiplier for the
stepsize. The smaller it is the smaller the steps are. Default
is \code{1}.}

\item{response_adjustment}{a (small) positive constant or a vector
of such. Default is \code{NULL}. See Details.}

\item{max_step_factor}{the maximum number of step halving steps to
consider. Default is \code{12}.}

\item{a}{power of the Jeffreys prior penalty. See Details.}
}
\value{
a list with components named as the arguments, including
    symbolic expressions for the dispersion transformation
    (\code{Trans}) and its inverse (\code{inverseTrans})
}
\description{
Typically only used internally by \code{\link{brglmFit}}, but may
be used to construct a \code{control} argument.
}
\details{
\code{\link{brglmControl}} provides default values and
    sanity checking for the various constants that control the
    iteration and generally the behaviour of
    \code{\link{brglmFit}}.

     When \code{trace} is true, calls to \code{cat} produce the
     output for each iteration.  Hence, \code{options(digits = *)}
     can be used to increase the precision.

     \code{transformation} sets the transformation of the
     dispersion parameter for which the bias reduced estimates are
     computed. Can be one of "identity", "sqrt", "inverse", "log"
     and "inverseSqrt". Custom transformations are accommodated by
     supplying a list of two expressions (transformation and
     inverse transformation). See the examples for more details.

     The value of \code{response_adjustment} is only relevant if
     \code{\link{brglmFit}} is called with \code{start = NULL}, and
     \code{family} is \code{\link{binomial}} or
     \code{\link{poisson}}. For those models, an initial maximum
     likelihood fit is obtained on adjusted data to provide
     starting values for the iteration in \code{brglmFit}. The
     value of \code{response_adjustment} governs how the data is
     adjusted. Specifically, if \code{family} is \code{binomial},
     then the responses and totals are adjusted by and \code{2 *
     response_adjustment}, respectively; if \code{family} is
     \code{poisson}, then the responses are adjusted by and
     \code{response_adjustment}. \code{response_adjustment = NULL}
     (default) is equivalent to setting it to
     "number of parameters"/"number of observations". 

. .  When \code{type = "AS_mixed"} (default), mean bias reduction is
    used for the regression parameters, and median bias reduction
    for the dispersion parameter, if that is not fixed. This
    adjustment has been developed based on equivariance arguments
    (see, Kosmidis et al, 2019, Section 4) in order to produce
    regression parameter estimates that are invariant to arbitrary
    contrasts, and estimates for the dispersion parameter that are
    invariant to arbitrary non-linear transformations. \code{type =
    "AS_mixed"} and \code{type = "AS_mean"} return the same results
    if \code{brglmFit} is called with \code{family} \code{binomial}
    or \code{poisson} (i.e. families with fixed dispersion). 

     When \code{type = "MPL_Jeffreys"}, \code{brglmFit} will
     maximize the penalized log-likelihood
     \deqn{l(\beta, \phi) + a\log \det i(\beta, \phi)}{l(beta, phi) + a log det i(beta, phi)} where \eqn{i(\beta, \phi)}{i(beta, phi)}
     is the expected information matrix about the regression
     parameters \eqn{\beta} and the dispersion parameter
     \eqn{\phi}. See, \code{vignette("iteration", "brglm2")} for more
     information. The argument $a$ controls the amount of
     penalization and its default value is \code{a = 1/2},
     corresponding to maximum penalized likelihood using a
     Jeffreys-prior penalty. See, Kosmidis & Firth (2019) for
     proofs and discussion about the finiteness and shrinkage
     properties of the maximum penalized likelihood estimators for
     binomial-response generalized linear models.

     The estimates from \code{type = "AS_mean"} and \code{type =
     "MPL_Jeffreys"} with \code{a = 1/2} (default) are identical
     for Poisson log-linear models and logistic regression models,
     i.e. for binomial and Poisson regression models with canonical
     links. See, Firth (1993) for details.
     
     \code{brglm_control} is an alias to \code{brglmControl}.
