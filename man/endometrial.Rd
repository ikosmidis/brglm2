\title{Histology grade and risk factors for 79 cases of endometrial cancer}
\format{
A data frame with 79 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{

\item{NV}{neovasculization with coding 0 for absent and 1 for present}

\item{PI}{pulsality index of arteria uterina}

\item{EH}{endometrium height}

\item{HG}{histology grade with coding 0 for low grade and 1 for high grade}

The packaged data set was downloaded in \code{.dat} format
    from \url{http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~aa/glm/data}. The latter
    link provides the data sets used in Agresti (2015).

    The endometrial data set was first analyzed in Heinze and
    Schemper (2002), and was originally provided by Dr
    E. Asseryanis from the Medical University of Vienna.
